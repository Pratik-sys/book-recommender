Tailoring the contents to the scope of individual semester courses is also an attempt to p- vide a?ordable (and “backpack-compatible”) textbooks without comprimising the quality and depth of content. This second volume, titled Core Algorithms, extends the introductory - terial presented in the ?rst volume (Fundamental Techniques) with additional techniques that are, nevertheless, part of the standard image processing to- box. A forthcomingthird volume(Advanced Techniques) will extendthis series and add important material beyond the elementary level, suitable for an - vanced undergraduate or even graduate course.",1,Springer,1848001940,978-1848001947,English,3/10/2013,4.91,,Principles of Digital Image Processing: Core Algorithms
